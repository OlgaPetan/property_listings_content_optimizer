This house was everything we wanted and more!  There is enough space for everyone to spread out.  The furniture is comfy.   We loved the soft knitted blankets on the couch.  They were perfect for curling up to watch a movie.  The hosts are incredible! They were very communicative and helpful but not intrusive.  they thought of every detail.  We would definitely stay here again.
