Other things to note
Please be aware and respect our house rules

⚠️ House rules:

🤫 Please be courteous to neighbors and keep the noise to a minimum when outside. We have decibel readers that track noise levels outside (these do not record conversations). We have had noise complaints from neighbors and have a $500 fine for excessive noise levels between 10pm-8am.

🚭 If smoking of any kind takes place inside, please note there will be a minimum charge of $500 for extra cleaning
🚬 Smoking outside is permitted.
🐾 A max of 2 dogs are allowed for a flat fee of $125/stay. NO CATS ALLOWED. Requests to bring a 3rd or 4th dog are subject to approval and will incur an additional $100 fee.
🚫 Undisclosed pets will result in a $150 fee and may lead to reservation cancellation without refund. You will be responsible for any additional cleaning or damage fees.
This is to protect guests with allergies and ensure our cleaners can keep the home in top condition for all visitors.
🚫 NO underage consumption or drugs
🎉 NO parties or large gatherings are permitted.
🚫Renters must be 21 years or older to book and stay.

📌⚠️ A friendly reminder to please remove your shoes when entering the house. The driveway has asphalt which can track dirt indoors. This helps us keep the space clean and comfortable for everyone. Thank you for your understanding!

📌I respect my neighbors to the fullest and will not tolerate any gatherings, parties, or unauthorized guests. If you violate any of my house rules or those of the OTA community, you will be required to vacate the property immediately, and no refund will be issued for any unused nights.
📌If the property is equipped with a grill, guests are responsible for refilling the propane tank if needed—but don’t worry, just send us the receipt and we’ll reimburse you! If it’s a charcoal grill, be sure to bring your own charcoal. Happy grilling!
📌Please note: While we provide a small list of checkout instructions, they are not mandatory but greatly appreciated to ensure a seamless transition for our next guests. Thank you!
