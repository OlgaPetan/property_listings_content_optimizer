🚫 Undisclosed pets will result in a $150 fee and may lead to reservation cancellation without refund. You will be responsible for any additional cleaning or damage fees.

📌I respect my neighbors to the fullest and will not tolerate any gatherings, parties, or unauthorized guests. If you violate any of my house rules or those of the OTA community, you will be required to vacate the property immediately, and no refund will be issued for any unused nights.
📌If the property is equipped with a grill, guests are responsible for refilling the propane tank if needed—but don’t worry, just send us the receipt and we’ll reimburse you! If it’s a charcoal grill, be sure to bring your own charcoal. Happy grilling!
